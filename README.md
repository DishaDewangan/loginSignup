## Features
- **User Signup**: Users can create an account with a username, email, phone number, and password.
- **User Login**: Registered users can log in using their username and password.
- **Password Hashing**: Passwords are hashed using bcrypt to ensure security.
- **Validation**: Basic validation for required fields and unique username/email.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB (for storing user data)
- **Password Security**: bcrypt (for hashing passwords)
